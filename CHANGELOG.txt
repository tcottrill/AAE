Changelog:

10/27/24 to 11/28/24

Major Fix: found and corrected a serious memory leak in the graphics core, this has been plaguing the emulator for so many years, fixes many small and (large) crashes and issues. error_tex[2], not error_tex[1]! 

Redid the PPC code on the Retrocade CMZ80 core, invalidated the PPC on Interrupt, this fixed all the decryption on the SegaG80 games. So that's what "Spurious Interrupts" means in the M.A.M.E(tm) driver. :(
Redid most of the SegaG80 driver, all games should be working correctly. 
More Z80 changes, they are in their own changelog.
Changed the 6502 cpu core back to mame style address handling, had to touch most of the drivers to fix issues. Fixed a pokey addressing issue with Black Widow, did a lot of cleanup on Major Havoc. 
Started cleanup of the graphics code, what a mess. Lots more to do. 
General cleanup everywhere, touched nearly every driver. 
Added back Star Wars, had to use very old M.A.M.E.(TM) driver code to get Luke to speak every time, I have this running in AAE2014 with modern drivers in other, cycle accurate timing code, and it still doesn't work there 100% either. I'll come back to it, at least it's working now, if not very accurate. Added different CPU handling to accomidate this. 
Now that the games are working mostly correctly, it's back to cleanup, consolidation, improving accuracy, and getting the menu system back working for sound and video. 

11/28/24 to 12/01/24

Cleaned up and added a new AY8910 core, added it to Omega Race and added nvram handling to all drivers that support it. Omega Race should be at least fairly accurate now.  
Reorganized all the OpenGl code in an attempt to make some sense of it. Added the Mushai 68000 core to maybe use with Quantum.

12/01/2024

Corrected the artwork sizing issues, this is the first build I would consider "mostly working" since 2007.

12/08/24

Made "major" changes to the Major Havoc driver, fixed nvram saving, added Major Havoc - The Promised End v1.01 to the driver. Will further split out everything and refine at a later date. Going back to graphics fixes.

12/11/24

Corrected the Menu System, first pass. Sound and Graphics Menus are working again, more or less. Still more work to do here with individual game configuration saves. Moved everything around to make it look at least a little bit better. 

12/12/14 Increased rendering time with another FBO, but it worked around a major rendering flaw allowing me to composite the menu and FPS onto the screen without doing any crazy scaling everywhere to compensate for screen sizes.
The menu system still needs work, I recommend not touching it except on the gui screen.

12/17/24 Many config and Menu changes, hopefully all the menu issues are resolved. 

12/21/24 Fixed main volume being too low, made too many changes to the menu system to list. More config changes to fix sound and graphics setting issues. Now the screen resolution can only be set in the gui, or by manually editing the config file.
Adjusted sound in asteroids and asteroids deluxe. Added clipping to tempest to stop the lines from going around the bezel in certain resolutions. Made a few graphic code changes to prep for more changes. Moved the game specific INI files to their own folder. 

12/22/24 Squashed the last rendering bug affecting the vertical games and battlezone. At this point, I think all the rendering is fixed, time to add a couple of features before completely changing the cpu and atari vector rendering.

12/26/24
Cleaned up video tick counting Code, adjusted AVG timing code for Major Havoc, this seems to clear up the issue with not being able to put in the secret code in mhavocpe. Or i'm way off base and I've made things worse, I don't have a real major havoc pcb to test with.

12/27/24
Found a ridiclous bug with counting the total cycles executed in the 6502 core. It was consistently underreporting the number of executed cycles, throwing everything off. Corrected.  

12/28/24 More Major Havoc cleanups. At this point I'll call it "Meh". It works pretty well, it's only a couple of percent off now as far as cycle emulation compared to the real board. To get it near perfect is going to require a complete rewrite, working on it. 
Cleaned up and removed dead code from cpu_control.h, trying to narrow down requirements for said rewrite.

2/5/24
Major Rewrite phase 1. Consolidated DVG code, moved everything to the mame style cpu/timing code, added mostly cycle accurate timing to most drivers. 
Started adding code to forklift to a complete newer core codeset. 

2/6/25
Fixed DVG issues. Fixed remaining watchdog issues. Hacked back in pause function.

2/12/25 Minor tweak to black widow size. Changed the zip loader to match other code I have written.

2/17/25
Merged the last of the old code out and cleaned up the Major Havoc driver. 
Misc code updates and bug fixes. Added a flag to disable the code profiling to keep the log from filling up. 
Input bugfix will require some tweaking on the analog sensitivity. This is an issue I am still battling in the new allegro free version with Rawinput.
Fixed most remaining volume issues. 

2/18/25
Changed the sampling in BattleZone to work better with my new sound code. 

2/22/25
Started updating the Cinematronics Driver, fixed drone sounds for star castle and others. Major re-org of the code.

2/25/25
Replaced some of the horribly depricated opengl rendering code with slightly less depricated rendering code. No increase in rendering speed though. Bummer.
