# A.A.E (Another Arcade Emulator)
AAE - Revisited

This is the placeholder for the 2023/Fix/Upgrade/Re-release of my 2007 A.A.E. (Another Arcade Emulator)

I've worked on this every off and on every couple of years since 2007, and decided to finally just upgrade the old release with proper working controls and art, a new backend windows engine (still not M.A.M.E) and re-release it. 

Code is in the master branch. 

I've dumped what I have completed, unfortunately it looks like I amm not going to get time to convert everything from the old allegro dll to my new code. Currently returning from the menu is broken. If I get time I will fix it. I have starwars working in a seperate framework that I meant to combine with this one, but I am not going to get the chance. I'll upload it seperately.
