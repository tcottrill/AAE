// AAE is a poorly written M.A.M.E (TM) derivitave based on early MAME 
// code, 0.29 through .90 mixed with code of my own. This emulator was 
// created solely for my amusement and learning and is provided only 
// as an archival experience. 
// 
// All MAME code used and abused in this emulator remains the copyright 
// of the dedicated people who spend countless hours creating it. All
// MAME code should be annotated as belonging to the MAME TEAM.
